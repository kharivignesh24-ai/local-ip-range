step1:Finding local ip address using cmd "ipconfig".
step2:scanning for open ports using"nmap -A<ip>"
step3:Run wireshark
step4:Capture packets
step5:Filter using cmd"ip.addr==1<ip>"
step6:compare the packet protocal with nmap to find the valid open ports
step7:search for the vulnerabilities

 135/tcp  MSRPC (Microsoft RPC)  - Remote code execution if unpatched (e.g., MS08-067)<br>- Can be exploited to gain
                                   administrative access remotely<br>- Often targeted by worms and malware                   |
