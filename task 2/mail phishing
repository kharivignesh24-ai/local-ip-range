The key factors that indicate phishing emails:
     1)The use of social engineering to create urgency and fear.
     2)Requests for sensitive information like passwords.
     3)Exploitation of a trusted brand.
To find whether the email is valid or not, the steps to be taken are:
     1)First, check the headers.
     2)Check the senderâ€™s email address.
     3)Check URLs safely.
Use these details to determine whether the email is valid or not.
Example:

This email pretends to be from the FDIC and offers a $50 reward for completing a survey.
It tries to appear legitimate by claiming the survey is anonymous and secure, 
but the promise of free money and the request to click a link are classic phishing techniques.
