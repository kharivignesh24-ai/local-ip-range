# Password Complexity Evaluation Report
From the evaluation results, these are the most effective practices for building a strong, secure password:

1. Use at least 12–16 characters Longer passwords are much harder and slower to crack.
2. Mix character types– Include:

   * Uppercase letters (A–Z)
   * Lowercase letters (a–z)
   * Numbers (0–9)
   * Special symbols (!, @, #, $, %, etc.)
3. Avoid common words or names – Simple passwords like “kumar” are very easy to guess and often appear in data breaches.
4. Use random combinations– Don’t use predictable patterns like “Password123” or “qwerty.”
5. Avoid reused passwords– Even a strong password becomes risky if it’s already leaked in a breach.
6. Use passphrases – Combine unrelated words with numbers and symbols (e.g., `Blue$Tree!Moon2025`).
7. Change passwords regularly – Especially if you suspect any account breach.
8. Use a password manager – It can create and store strong, unique passwords for every account.


7. Common Password Attacks

1. Brute Force Attack

   * The attacker tries every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found.
   * Longer and more complex passwords take exponentially more time to crack, making brute-force attacks impractical.

2. Dictionary Attack

   * The attacker uses a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and leaked passwords to guess quickly.
   * Passwords based on simple words (like `kumar`) are vulnerable to this type of attack.
8. How Password Complexity Affects Security

*Length: Every additional character increases the time and computing power needed to crack a password.
*Character Variety:Using a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols multiplies the number of possible combinations.
*Randomness: Random, non-dictionary words reduce the chance of success from dictionary attacks.
* Uniqueness: Unique passwords for each account protect you from credential stuffing.

Summary:
The stronger (longer, more complex, random, and unique) your password is, the more resistant it is to brute force and dictionary attacks. Weak passwords are cracked in seconds, but strong ones can take centuries — making them nearly impossible for attackers to break.
